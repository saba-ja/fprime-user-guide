= NASA F Prime Framework

== Introduction

NASA F Prime is a software framework developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that provides a reusable and flexible architecture for building space mission software systems. It is designed to facilitate the development of reliable and efficient flight software for space missions by providing a set of tools, libraries, and guidelines. F Prime provides a structured and modular approach to building software, allowing for easier development, testing, and maintenance of complex space systems. 

The goal of this user guide is to simplify the learning process and empower developers to effectively utilize the F Prime framework in their mission software development tasks. To achieve this, the user guide will document the framework's features, components, and best practices, provide step-by-step instructions, and offer examples and tutorials that assist users in navigating and understanding the framework's functionalities.
