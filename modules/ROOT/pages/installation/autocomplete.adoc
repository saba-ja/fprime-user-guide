= CLI Autocomplete

== Tab Completion for Command-Line Tools

This guide will walk you through the installation process of the command line tools' autocomplete feature. This feature is compatible with several popular shells, including `bash`, `fish`, and `tcsh`. However, please note that due to the limitations of the support library we use, we are unable to provide support for shells that are not included in this library.

While you can start using the GDS command line tools immediately after installing F', enabling autocomplete will require a few additional steps outlined in this guide. Once autocomplete is activated, using it is straightforward: simply press the `[TAB]` key, and the active command line options will be automatically filled in. If multiple options are available, you can press `[TAB]` twice to display all possible choices and continue typing until only one matching choice remains.

== Installing Autocomplete

After installing F', you can use the following commands to set up autocomplete. Autocomplete works by registering certain variables into the current shell. Therefore, users have two options for working with these tools: 

- Manually setting up in each shell 
- Activating them alongside the virtual environment 

Manually activating per-shell requires a manual step but doesn't alter the Python-managed virtual environment file. On the other hand, activating them along with the virtual environment is convenient, but it modifies a file managed by Python, which could potentially cause problems across different Python versions.

NOTE: It is possible to add these commands to a `.bashrc` or `.cshrc` file but this is outside the scope of this guide.

=== Manual Activation (Run In Each New Shell)

These Commands can be run directly in each shell to provide autocomplete. This setup will end when the shell process is closed, so they should be run on each new shell that is opened.

*Bash*: 

    `eval "$(register-python-argcomplete fprime-cli)"`

*zsh*:

. Enable `bashcompinit` by running the following:
+
[,bash]
----
 autoload -U bashcompinit
 bashcompinit
----

. Run `eval "$(register-python-argcomplete fprime-cli)"`

*fish*: 

    Run `register-python-argcomplete --shell fish fprime-cli | source`

*tcsh*: 

    Run `eval `register-python-argcomplete --shell tcsh fprime-cli``

=== Activating With Python Virtual Environment

Since most users run F' through a virtual environment, it would be easy to place the above commands into the virtual environment activation script. In this way, every time the user activates the environment to work with F', autocomplete is also activated. However, making these changes change the virtual environment's activation scripts, which could have unanticipated effects should the virtual environment file format change.  This is unlikely and reinstalling F' while omitting this section would fix any problems caused by this.


*zsh pre-setup*: Enable `bashcompinit` by running the following:

[,bash]
----
autoload -U bashcompinit
bashcompinit
----

*Bash/zsh*: 

`register-python-argcomplete fprime-cli >> $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate`

*fish*: 

`register-python-argcomplete --shell fish fprime-cli >> $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate.fish`

*tcsh*: 

`register-python-argcomplete --shell tcsh fprime-cli >> $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate.csh`

NOTE: To take advantage of these changes immediately, reactivate the virtual environment at this point.

== Autocomplete Tool Support

Autocomplete is currently available with the `fprime-cli` tool. Currently, you can use tab completion in the GDS CLI tool to complete sub-command names, options, file paths, and even the available commands on the F' instance you're running. 

== Further Information

F' has its CLI tools written in Python, and we've implemented tab completion through the https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete[argcomplete,window=_blank] library. If you have any troubleshooting concerns, want to extend these tools, or need to explore more advanced settings, this documentation would be the starting point for troubleshooting.
