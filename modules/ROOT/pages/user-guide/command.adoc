= Commands

== Command Overview

Each **Component** defines a set of commands for operations. Unlike pipes, which are intended for component to component communication, commands are designed for user interaction with a component. Commands are defined through a series of properties. Users can send commands to the F' system and via `Svc::CmdDispatcher` these commands are dispatched to a handling component to invoke some behavior. The handling component handles a command by defining a command handler function to run when the command arrives.

== Command Properties

The properties defining commands are shown below:

1. `kind`: (sync, async, guarded) controls which execution context the command runs in. Sync and guarded commands run on the execution context of the command dispatcher which is in charge of sending commands to components that have functions to handle the commands. Async commands execute on the component threads that is going to handle the command.

2. Keyword `command`: is a reserved word in FPP and indicates the script is a for `command` definition.

3. `mnemonic`: a text value uniquely representing the command. The component instance name is prepended to the mnemonic to ensure uniqueness in the system.

4. `arguments`: a set of primitive and F' data types supplied to the command handler to adjust its execution. These arguments are sent from the ground.

5. `opcode`: a numerical value uniquely representing the command. This opcode is automatically adjusted to be relative to a component's base id, and thus will not collide with other commands defined by other components.

== Kinds of Command 

As specified above a command can be one of the following kinds: async, sync, or guarded which defines the execution context the command. Let's open up the idea in more details.

When an async command is sent by the user the command arrives on a message queue, to be dispatched on the destination component's thread (if this component is active) or on the thread of a port invocation (if this component is queued).

----
async:
[Command Dispatcher] ---Command---> [Message Queue] --Dispatch--> [Component's Thread or Port's Thread]
|                  |                |             |               |                                   |
 --- (A) ---                         --- (B) ---                    --- (C) ---

- (A) represents the entity that is sending the command asynchronously.
- (B) represents the message queue where commands are stored until they can be processed.
- (C) represents the thread of the active component or port that will handle the command.
----

When a sync command is sent by the user the command invokes a handler defined in the destination component, and run on the thread of the caller. That means that the command runs immediately on the thread of the invoking component (for example, a command dispatcher component). A synchronous command is a command that blocks the execution of other commands until it completes. Since the command runs immediately, its handler should be very short. For example, it could set a flag and then exit.

----
sync:
[Command Dispatcher] ---Command---> [Component's Handler]
|                  |                |                   |
 --- (A) ---                         --- (B) ---

- (A) represents the entity that is sending the command synchronously.
- (B) represents the component's handler which runs the command.
----

When a guarded command is sent by the user the execution behavior is similar to sync command, but the handler is guarded by a mutual exclusion lock. A mutex (short for mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one thread or task can access a guarded resource at a time. It prevents multiple executions of the same guarded command from overlapping. When a guarded command is executed, it acquires the mutex associated with it, ensuring exclusive access to the guarded resource or section of code. If another execution of the same guarded command is attempted while the mutex is held, it will wait until the mutex is released before proceeding. This mechanism helps prevent conflicts and maintain data integrity.

----
guarded:
[Command Dispatcher] --Command--> [Component's Guarded Handler] -Mutex lock-> [Execution]
|                  |              |                           |               |           |
 --- (A) ---                       --- (B) ---                                 --- (C) ---

- (A) represents the entity that is sending the command.
- (B) represents the handler in the component that is guarded by a mutex lock.
- (C) represents the execution of the command which only happens when it can acquire the mutex lock.

== Where to define commands

Commands are defined in the component's FPP file. In the example below the we have a project called led-blinker and it has component called Led. The commands of the component are defined in the Led.fpp file.

----
└── led-blinker
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── Components
    │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
    │   └── Led
    │       ├── CMakeLists.txt
    │       ├── Led.cpp
    │       ├── Led.fpp
    │       ├── Led.hpp

== Defining commands in FPP

The most basic form of a command comprises a kind (such as sync, async, guarded), followed by the keyword command, and a mnemonic serving as the command's name.

[source,fpp]
----
active component MyComp {

  async command START
  
  guarded command TOGGLE

  sync command STOP

}
----

The example above specifies the behavior of the "MyComp" component using F Prime Prime syntax. Here's the breakdown of the commands:

* `async command START`: This line declares an asynchronous command called "START". When the "START" command is executed, it will be placed in a message queue and will be executed when the target component is ready to accept the command.

* `guarded command TOGGLE`: This line declares a guarded command called "TOGGLE". This command will only run if mutex is not held by any other commands.

* `sync command STOP`: This line declares a synchronous command called "STOP". In this example when the "STOP" command is executed, it halts the execution of other commands until it finishes.

== Command Parameters


== Command Dispatching

When commands are defined for a component, the autocoder automatically adds ports for registering and receiving commands, and reporting an execution status when finished. Each component that handles commands should be hooked up to the command dispatcher connecting the registration, dispatch, and response ports in parallel.

![Command Dispatcher](../media/data_model1.png)

**Figure 4. Command dispatcher.** The command dispatcher receives the raw buffer containing the command and arguments.
The command opcode is extracted, and a lookup table is used to find the handling component. The argument buffer is then
passed to the component, and the command dispatcher waits without blocking for the component to return status..

In many projects, commands need to be sequenced in order. In order to facilitate this, the framework provides
`Svc::CmdSequencer`. The command sequencer reads a defined sequence of commands and sends each in turn to the command
dispatcher to be dispatched and the command execution status is returned to the sequencer.  This is an alternate path to
send command buffers to the command dispatcher than the external path from ground.

== Command Sequencing

![Command Sequencer](../media/data_model2.png)

**Figure 5. Command sequence.** The command sequencer loads a sequence file from the file system, sends the command,
 and waits for the response for each command in the sequence. A failed response terminates the sequence,
while a successful response moves to the next command in the sequence.
